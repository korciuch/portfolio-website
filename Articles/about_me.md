#### Background 

I attended Lake Central High School in Saint John, IN from 2014-2018 and specialized in engineering design & precision machining through the vocational program there.  Upon graduating high school, I knew that I wanted study an engineering discipline; however, I wasn't sure which one.  Since my father owns his own IT consulting firm and my younger brother has been doing work for him for years, I was influenced to try out computer science at Stanford; though, the journey has been very challenging, yet rewarding.  At first, I felt like an infinitesimally small fish in a large pond, though as time went on, I felt myself belonging at Stanford more and more.  From taking my first 'recursive leap of faith,' to building my own heap allocator, to most recently writing my first Naive Bayes classifier, I've started to gain a lot more confidence in my abilities, as an aspiring CS/AI B.S. candidate. 

#### Student-Athlete Experience

Part of my Stanford admissions profile was my experience as a student-athlete.  I was a member of the Chicago Fire Academy, an elite soccer program, from 2012 to 2018.  My experience in those days sharpened my time management skills as I missed at least 1-2 weeks of school every year on average traveling across the country and beyond for competition.  At Stanford, I wrongfully felt that being a student-athlete would limit my career opportunities and constrain my commitments; nonetheless, I've come to learn that it is actually one of my greatest strengths as for it taught me very important lessons about the competitive world that exists today.  

#### Stanford Men's Soccer

When I arrived at the Stanford Men's Soccer program in the summer of 2018, I wasn't as strong mentally and physically - there were times when I thought that I wanted to pivot to being a regular student because things got really tough, barely balancing a technical major and competitive soccer.  However, our head coach Jeremy Gunn instilled in us the growth mindset mentality.  He has always taught that backing down due to being uncomfortable and challenged stifles overall growth and diminishes resiliency.  I personally strive to join organizations where I am initially a small player, but leave amongst the most influential.  This happened when I joined the academy, as I struggled to get playing time for a couple seasons until I made my breakthrough starting season in 2016.  Strictly more recently, when faced with the challenge of the pandemic, restrictive Santa Clara public health guidelines, and a postponed 2020 season, our team has practiced what he preached by 'competing with ourselves' dispersed around the country during the restrictive lockdowns this year.

### Interests
#### Technical
The earliest memory I can remember myself showing interest into the precursors of data science was in my 6th grade pre-algebra class.  My math teacher, Mr. Ashby, pointed out that I was making really neat histograms and box-and-whisker plots (I spent a little to much time matching the graph shading to the legend key haha).  However, I became disillusioned with visualizing data in high school and I wanted to take a more tactile approach, designing and building things that I could see, feel, touch, etc.  I took a break from the world of computing and spent a couple years working on my CAD and CNC machining skills.  This even resulted in me contemplating civil engineering / architecture as a field of study; however, I soon realized that the path to becoming an architect was simply not for me, and I returned to the reality of my natural inclination to acquire, visualize, and interpret data for a wide array of audiences. 

#### Personal
Apart from my technical interests, I enjoy hiking, running, and cycling, whenever I'm not training with the team.  I absolutely cherish exploring new areas with a wide array of inputs, whether it be natural, historical, or architectural.  One of my most favorite things to do in the Bay Area is taking my bike on the caboose of the northbound Caltrain, and cycling to the Marina Headlands, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, all the way from Central Station in SF.
