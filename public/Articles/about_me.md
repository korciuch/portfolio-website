#### Background 

I attended Lake Central High School in Saint John, IN from 2014-2018 and specialized in engineering design & precision machining through the vocational program there.  Upon graduating high school, I knew that I wanted study an engineering discipline; however, I wasn't sure which one.  Since my father owns his own IT consulting firm and my younger brother has been doing work for him for years, I was influenced to try out computer science at Stanford; though, the journey has been very challenging, yet rewarding.  At first, I felt like an infinitesimally small fish in a large pond, though as time went on, I felt myself belonging at Stanford more and more.  From taking my first 'recursive leap of faith,' to building my own heap allocator, to writing my first Naive Bayes classifier, I realized that computer science is a truly universal discipline that has unlimited applications in any other field.

#### Student-Athlete Experience

Part of my Stanford admissions profile was my experience as a student-athlete.  I was a member of the Chicago Fire Academy, an elite soccer program, from 2012 to 2018.  My experience in those days sharpened my time management skills as I missed at least 1-2 weeks of school every year on average traveling across the country and beyond for competition.  At Stanford, I wrongfully felt that being a student-athlete would limit my career opportunities and constrain my commitments; nonetheless, I've come to learn that it is actually one of my greatest strengths as for it taught me very important lessons about the competitive world that exists today.  

When I arrived at the Stanford Men's Soccer program in the summer of 2018, I definitely wasn't as strong mentally and physicallyâ€”there were countless times that I wanted to pivot to being a 'regular' student because things got really tough, barely balancing a technical major and competitive soccer.  However, our head coach Jeremy Gunn instilled in us the growth mindset mentality.  He has always taught that backing down due to being uncomfortable and challenged stifles overall growth and diminishes resiliency.  These are practical lessons that have transfered over to the field of entrepreneurship very well for me, as I have faced setbacks and made numerous mistakes started out with CausalTwin.
